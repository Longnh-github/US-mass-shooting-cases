# US MASS SHOOTING CASES
March 20, 2023

## 1. Context

After reading news about the mass shooting incident that occurred at Michigan University, I decided to analyze previous mass shooting cases in the US and take out some informative insights.

Data source: [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)

## 2. Note

According to the article, there are a few cases that were not included in the dataset, so the data is representative but not perfect.

I did not compare this data to other countries worldwide.

There are several null records in the database.

## 3. Data analysis

First, I import the [raw data](https://github.com/Longnh-github/US-mass-shooting-cases/blob/main/mass%20shooting%20US_raw.csv) into postgreSQL.

Then I prepare and export a cleaned CSV file using this [SQL query](https://github.com/Longnh-github/US-mass-shooting-cases/blob/main/mass_shooting.sql).

You can check the final result here: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/long7032/viz/USmassshootingcases/Dashboard1)

## 4. Insights

Based on the analyzed data, here are some conclusions I can draw:

- California, Texas, and Florida are the three states with the most cases.

- There are the most incidents in February, June, and November.

- The data visualization illustrates that the number of mass shooting cases has been gradually rising throughout the years.

- The majority of perpetrators are white, young, male adults from 18 to 30 years old.

- Nearly half of the criminals show no prior mental problems.
